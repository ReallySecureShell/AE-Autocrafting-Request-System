## Description
The AE Autocrafting Request System is a system that is used to automatically request crafting jobs for specific items.
The system itself comprises of multiple different components: a ComputerCraft or CC:Tweaked computer, redstone conduits 
from EnderIO, and ME export buses with redstone and autocrafting cards. 

However, it should be noted that this system was built within the FTB Infinity Evolved modpack for MC 1.7.10. Which at the time
did not have a way to submit a crafting request with a ComputerCraft or CC:Tweaked computer.
